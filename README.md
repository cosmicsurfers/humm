# Humm Publisher 0.1

Humm Publisher is a destination-independent personal publishing application in which an author can write, manage, and license stories for publication in various destinations powered by Holochain.

## Heads Up

The current state of the Humm Publisher is a working proof-of-concept that uses vanilla Javascript and is currently being used on http://humm.earth/blog. Once the Holochain Rust comes out it will be refactored and re-built with ReactJS + Redux.

Validations features haven't been implemented yet. Therefore, is not recommended to use it in production unless you decide to change the Application DNA Hash and interact with trusted nodes only.
