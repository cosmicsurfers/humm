# Humm Publisher 0.1

Humm Publisher is a destination-independent personal publishing application in which an author can write, manage, and license stories for publication in various destinations powered by Holochain.

## Overview

The current state of the Humm Publisher is a working proof-of-concept that uses vanilla JavaScript with no extra libraries and is currently being used on the [Humm Blog](http://humm.earth/blog). Once the Holochain Rust comes out it will be re-factored and the frontend re-built with ReactJS + Redux. Additionally, the validation features haven't been implemented yet, so is not recommended to use it in production unless you decide to change the Application DNA Hash in order interact with trusted agents. 

## Using the Application

[The application uses Holochain Proto](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-proto). After installing it, use one of the commands from the [following page](https://developer.holochain.org/Command_Line_Tools) and you will be ready to go.
